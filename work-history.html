  <p><strong>Duties:</strong> I was responsible for the creation of a geodatabase for Larchmont, New York that included the following infrastructure systems and data layers: water distribution, storm-water, street paving, sanitary sewer and utility pole/power-line charges. Larchmont’s municipal data for these systems needed to be updated, requiring polygon and polyline layers to be created for each outdated attribute within the appropriate system. To do so I referenced and scribed changes to Larchmont water maps, GIS layer files provided by the Westchester County GIS department, Obrien and Gere engineering Maps and Con-Edison “charge” maps. For each layer, all necessary attribute data was collected and previously outdated attribute information (i.e. valve numbers) were corrected.

Lastly I generated a detailed map “series” for Larchmont that included all of the new infrastructural data and presented the hardcopy maps to the mayor of Larchmont (Anne H. McAndrews). <br><br> Data creation and population of a street sign inventory for Larchmont, using ArcGIS Online and the ArcGIS Collector smartphone GPS application.
